# Downloading Company Profile data from Companies House
## Overview
This Python script takes a CSV file with a list of company numbers (and charity ids) and downloads their company profile data from the Companies House API. It both creates an output CSV with some key fields, as well as saving the raw JSON returned by the API query for each company.
